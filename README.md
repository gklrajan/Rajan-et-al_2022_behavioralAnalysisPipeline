DC_CurvatureBased_HBT.m and ZF_CurvatureBased_HBT.m are used for the analysis of the short-term swimming kinematics of Danionella and zebrafish, respectively.

Compare_ZF-DC_MSD-R.m (for long-term kinematics) is used on both the fish to calculate the Mean Square Displacement (MSD) and the reorientation kinematics using heading correlation (R).

All example data is available here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1nDyCEUc7RMN7Yd9BR7LMjlCjKkhfxsbC?usp=sharing
The data folder contains fish-wise datasets prepared for the aforementioned short- and long-term analysis scripts.

The folder 'usefulFunctions' contains a few external functions used in the scripts. Please add it to your MATLAB path.
